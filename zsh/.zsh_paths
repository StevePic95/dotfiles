# all additions to the PATH variable go here (e.g., "export PATH=...")
# paths are only added if the directory actually exists

# user's private bin (pip/pipx installed tools, claude, etc.)
[[ -d ~/.local/bin ]] && export PATH=~/.local/bin:${PATH}

# example: conditionally add a directory to PATH only if it exists
# [[ -d ~/my_tools/bin ]] && export PATH=~/my_tools/bin:${PATH}
