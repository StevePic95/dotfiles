## tmux Configuration Notes
Based on the configuration described in [this DreamsOfCode YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzNmUNvnB04&t=426s).

The tmux package manager must be installed for the config file to work, but it is easy to use and installed with git (outlined in video above).
